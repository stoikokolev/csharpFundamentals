5. Back in 30 Minutes
Every time Stamat tries to pay his bills he sees on the cash desk the sign: "I will be back in 30 minutes". One day Stamat was sick of waiting and decided he needs a program, which prints the time after 30 minutes. That way he won’t have to wait on the desk and come at the appropriate time. He gave the assignment to you, so you have to do it.

Hints
Add 30 minutes to the initial minutes, which you receive from the console. If the minutes are more than 59 – increase the hours with 1 and decrease the minutes with 60. The same way check if the hours are more than 23. When you print check for leading zero.
