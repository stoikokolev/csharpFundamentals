1. Hero Recruitment

Greetings, champions of Azeroth. Welcome to the Chapels. Here, we will test your skill and knowledge to decide if you are ready to defend our beloved world. I wish you luck champions. For Honour and Glory!

Create a program that keeps track of enrolled heroes and their collection of spells (spellbook).  You will be receiving the following commands until you receive the command "End":

"Enroll {HeroName}":
Adds the hero to your collection of heroes.
If the hero is already present in your collection, print: "{HeroName} is already enrolled."
"Learn {HeroName} {SpellName}":
Adds the {SpellName} to the {HeroName}'s spellbook.
If the {HeroName} doesn’t exist in the collection, print: "{HeroName} doesn't exist."
If the hero already has the spell in his spellbook print: "{HeroName} has already learnt {SpellName}."
"Unlearn {HeroName} {SpellName}":
Remove the {SpellName} from the {HeroName}'s spellbook.
If the {HeroName} doesn’t exist in the collection, print: "{HeroName} doesn't exist."
If the {SpellName} doesn't exist in the hero's spellbook, print: "{HeroName} doesn't know {SpellName}."

After you receive the "End" command, print all the heroes sorted by their count of spells in descending and then by the hero name ascending in the format described below:

"Heroes:
== {name1}: {spell1}, {spell2}, {spelln}
== {name2}: {spell1}, {spell2}, {spelln}
...
== {nameN}: {spell1}, {spell2}, {spelln}
