2. Change List
Write a program, which reads a list of integers from the console and receives commands, which manipulate the list. Your program may receive the following commands: 
Delete {element} – delete all elements in the array, which are equal to the given element.
Insert {element} {position} – insert an element and the given position.
You should stop the program when you receive the command "end". Print the numbers in the array separated by a single whitespace.
