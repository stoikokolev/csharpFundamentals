Number Array

Create a program that helps you keep track of a number array. First, you are going to receive the numbers оn a single line, separated by space, in the following format:
"{number1} {number2} {number3}… {numbern}"
Then you will start receiving commands until you read the "End" message. There are five possible commands:
"Switch {index}"
Find the number on this index in your collection, if the index exists, and switch its sign (negative <-> positive).  
"Change {index} {value}"
Replace the number on the given index with the number given, if the index exists.
"Sum Negative"
Print the sum of all negative numbers.
"Sum Positive"
Print the sum of all positive numbers.
"Sum All"
Print the sum of all numbers.
In the end, print the positive numbers on a single line, keeping in mind that 0 is positive, separated by a single space in the following format:
"{number1} {number2} {number3}… {numbern}"
Input
On the 1st line you are going to receive the numbers of the array (always integers), separated by a single space.
On the next lines, until the "End" command is received, you will be receiving commands.
Output
Print the tasks in the format described above.

Comments
First, we receive the command "Switch 4" and we make the number on index 4 negative (because it is positive before the command). After this command, the task collection looks like this: 
1 2 3 4 -5
Afterwards, we receive the "Change 0 -3" command and we need to change the number on index 0 with the number -3. The collection looks like this now: 
-3 2 3 4 -5
After that, we receive the "Sum Negative" command, which means we need to print the sum of all negative numbers and it is -8.
In the end, we print all of the positive numbers. This is the result collection:
2 3 4
 

1 2 3 4 5 4 3 2 1 0
Switch -4
Change 13 0
Switch 0
Sum All
End
23
2 3 4 5 4 3 2 1 0
