Hints
You should divide n by p. This gives you the number of full courses (e.g. 17 / 3 = 5).
If n does not divide p without a remainder, you will need one additional partially full course (e.g. 17 % 3 = 2).
Another approach is to round up n / p to the nearest integer (ceiling), e.g. 17/3 = 5.67  rounds up to 6.
