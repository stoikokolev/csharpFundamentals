Password Reset
Yet again you have forgotten your password... Naturally it`s not the first time this has happened. Actually you got so tired of it that you decided to help yourself with a smart solution. 

Write a password reset program that performs a series of commands upon a predefined string. First, you will receive a string and afterwards, until the command "Done" is given, you will be receiving strings with commands split by a single space. The commands will be the following:
TakeOdd
 Takes only the characters at odd indices and concatenates them together to
obtain the new raw password and then prints it.
Cut {index} {length}
Gets the substring with the given length starting from the given index from the password and removes its first occurrence of it, then prints the password on the console.
The given index and length will always be valid.
Substitute {substring} {substitute}
If the raw password contains the given substring, replaces all of its 
occurrences with the substitute text given and prints the result.
If it doesn’t, prints "Nothing to replace!"
Input
You will be receiving strings until the "Done" command is given.
Output
After the "Done" command is received, print:
"Your password is: {password}"
Constraints
The indexes from the "Cut {index} {length}" command will always be valid.
Examples
Input
Output
Siiceercaroetavm!:?:ahsott.:i:nstupmomceqr 
TakeOdd
Cut 15 3
Substitute :: -
Substitute | ^
Done
icecream::hot::summer
icecream::hot::mer
icecream-hot-mer
Nothing to replace!
Your password is: icecream-hot-mer
Comments
TakeOdd
Siiceercaroetavm!:?:ahsott.:i:nstupmomceqr -> icecream::hot::summer
We only take the chars at odd indices 1, 3, 5 etc.
Cut 15  3 -> icecream::hot::summer -> sum
icecream::hot::mer
We cut a substring starting at index 15 with length 3, 
remove it from the raw password and print it. 
Then, on a new line we print the resulting new raw password.
Substitute :: - -> icecream::hot::summer -> icream-hot-summer
We replace "::" with "-".
Substitute | ^ -> Nothing to replace! 
"|" is not found anywhere in the raw password.
Finally, after receiving the "Done" command, we print the resulting password in the proper format.
