1. Boss Rush

Ah, look who arrived, the latecomer. Let me repeat our plan for our friend here. There is a hoard of demons  in this room. We must first identify them before we can proceed.

Create a program that checks if inputs are valid and decrypt it. On the first line you will receive a number that indicates how many inputs you will receive on the next lines.

You will read lines with a boss name and title and you should check if they are valid, considering the following rules:
Boss - the name should be in upper case letters, should be minimum four letters long and should be surrounded by "|"
Title - contains exactly 2 words and they contain only alphabetical letters and 1 whitespace between them. The title should be surrounded by "#"
The name and title should be split by a single ":"
Example for a valid input:  |GEORGI|:#Lead architect#
If the input is valid. Print in the following format:
"{boss name}, The {title}
>> Strength: {length of the name}
>> Armour: {length of the title}"

If the input is invalid, print "Access denied!"
Input / Constraints
On the 1st line, you will receive a number of inputs.
On the next n lines, you will have to check if a boss has a valid name and title.
Output
Print the output with the format described above.
